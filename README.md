- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

The page layout is nice but I for somereason do not like the agreement check box and would go for something more nuetral in color. The second part of the page with the videos bothered me becayse it didn't line up with the top section. The circle with pulse is my favorite part.
